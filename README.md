# Truffle-Tutorial-ERC721
### Repo for deploying and minting NFTs for opensea with truffle and ipfs

### Soon I shall write a blog post on https://dev.to explaining whats going on here. 

This is inspired by opensea's tutorial: https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-creatures and https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721
and is supposed to be an expanded version (with ipfs and solidity at a higher version). With that, I shall explain what is going on clearly in the future blog post. 

Once again, huge credit to opensea, ethereum infrastructure, and ipfs for making it all possible for me to build on and learn with.
